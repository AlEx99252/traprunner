             network is an essential element of very successful business. it's provides you with contacts, leads, clients, partners, suppliers, and much more. it carries your name and your business reputation further and more efficiently   than most advertising. Most importantly, it's an endless source of profit, ideals, collaboration, and support. If you are networking,you should do more.  If you are't networking, you need to start. If you not networkin, your business will stagnate and die.
